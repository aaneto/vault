# Vault

I have a major problem with my github account, often I create repositories to help me control projects and after they are done or I am done with them, they are deleted and saved on a tar.gz somewhere.



The thing is: many of those projects are nice, but they are too many and often  small and not good enough to expose as single repositories. So my solution is this repo, a Vault for all the projects that I decided I won't work anymore.
